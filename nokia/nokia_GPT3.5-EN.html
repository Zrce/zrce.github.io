<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p class='aitext'>Nokia is a Finnish multinational telecommunications and consumer electronics company. It was founded in 1865 and initially started as a pulp mill. Over the years, Nokia has evolved and diversified its business, becoming a major player in the mobile phone industry. It was once the world's largest vendor of mobile phones, known for its durable and reliable devices. However, with the rise of smartphones, Nokia faced challenges and eventually sold its mobile phone business to Microsoft in 2014. Since then, Nokia has focused on network infrastructure, software, and licensing its brand to other manufacturers for smartphones and other devices.</p>
