<p id='aitext'> Nokia is a Finnish multinational telecommunications, information technology, and consumer electronics company, founded in 1865. Nokia is headquartered in Espoo, Finland, and is the world's largest manufacturer of mobile phones and smartphones. Nokia also provides network infrastructure, software, and services for telecommunications operators and enterprises.  Nokia's history can be traced back to 1865, when Fredrik Idestam founded a paper mill in Tampere, Finland. In the early 20th century, Nokia expanded into other industries, including rubber, cables, and electronics. In the 1960s, Nokia began to focus on telecommunications, and in the 1980s, it became a major player in the mobile phone market.  In the 1990s, Nokia became the world's largest mobile phone manufacturer, and in the early 2000s, it introduced the Symbian operating system, which was used on many of its smartphones. However, Nokia's market share began to decline in the late 2000s, as Apple and Android-based smartphones gained popularity.  In 2013, Nokia sold its mobile phone business to Microsoft, and in 2016, it acquired Alcatel-Lucent, a French telecommunications company. Nokia is now focused on providing network infrastructure, software, and services for telecommunications operators and enterprises.  Nokia is a global company with operations in over 100 countries. It employs over 100,000 people and has annual revenues of over â‚¬20 billion. Nokia is listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange and is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 index.</p>
