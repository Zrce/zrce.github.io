<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p id='aitext'> Nokia is a Finnish multinational telecommunications, information technology, and consumer electronics company, founded in 1865. It is headquartered in Espoo, Finland. Nokia is best known for its mobile phones, which were once the world's most popular. The company also produces a wide range of other products, including smartphones, tablets, laptops, and networking equipment.  Nokia was founded as a paper mill in 1865 by Fredrik Idestam. The company expanded into the telecommunications industry in the 1960s, and by the 1990s it had become one of the world's leading mobile phone manufacturers. Nokia's market share peaked in 2007, when it held a 38% share of the global mobile phone market.  However, Nokia's market share began to decline in the late 2000s, as it was slow to adapt to the smartphone revolution. In 2013, Nokia sold its mobile phone business to Microsoft for $7.2 billion. Microsoft continued to use the Nokia brand on its smartphones, but the company's market share continued to decline.  In 2016, Microsoft sold the Nokia brand and its feature phone business to HMD Global, a Finnish company. HMD Global has since released a number of new Nokia-branded smartphones, and the company has seen some success in the mid-range and budget smartphone markets.  Nokia is a global company with operations in over 100 countries. It employs over 90,000 people and has annual revenues of over â‚¬20 billion. Nokia is a publicly traded company, and its shares are listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange.</p>
