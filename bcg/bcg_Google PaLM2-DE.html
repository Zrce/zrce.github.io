<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p id='aitext'> BCG stands for Bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin. It is a live attenuated vaccine used to prevent tuberculosis (TB). It is made from a weakened strain of the bacterium that causes TB, Mycobacterium bovis. BCG vaccine is given to infants and children in many countries around the world, and it is estimated to have prevented millions of cases of TB.  BCG vaccine is not 100% effective, and it does not provide lifelong protection against TB. However, it can reduce the risk of developing TB by up to 80%. BCG vaccine is also effective in preventing severe forms of TB, such as miliary TB and TB meningitis.  BCG vaccine is generally safe, but it can cause some side effects, such as fever, swelling at the injection site, and lymph node enlargement. These side effects are usually mild and go away on their own.  BCG vaccine is not recommended for people who have certain medical conditions, such as immunodeficiency disorders or HIV infection. It is also not recommended for pregnant women.  BCG vaccine is an important tool in the fight against TB. It is a safe and effective vaccine that can help to prevent this serious disease.</p>
