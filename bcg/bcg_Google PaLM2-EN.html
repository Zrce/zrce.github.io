<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p> BCG stands for Bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin. It is a live attenuated vaccine used to prevent tuberculosis (TB). It is made from a weakened strain of the bacterium that causes TB, Mycobacterium bovis. BCG vaccine is given to infants, children, and adults who are at high risk of developing TB. It is usually given as a single injection into the upper arm.  BCG vaccine is safe and effective. It can prevent TB in up to 80% of people who are vaccinated. However, it does not provide complete protection, and some people who are vaccinated may still develop TB. BCG vaccine is not recommended for people who have a weakened immune system or who are pregnant.  BCG vaccine is used in many countries around the world, but it is not available in the United States. This is because TB is not as common in the United States as it is in other countries. However, BCG vaccine may be recommended for people who are traveling to or living in countries where TB is common.</p>
