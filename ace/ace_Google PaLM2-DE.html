<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p> **ACE** stands for **A**ngiotensin-**C**onverting **E**nzyme. It is an enzyme that plays a key role in regulating blood pressure. ACE inhibitors are a class of medications that block the action of ACE, which can lower blood pressure.  ACE is found in the lungs and kidneys. It converts angiotensin I, a hormone that causes blood vessels to constrict, into angiotensin II, a more potent vasoconstrictor. Angiotensin II also stimulates the release of aldosterone, a hormone that causes the kidneys to retain sodium and water. This can lead to an increase in blood pressure.  ACE inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which can lower blood pressure. They are commonly used to treat high blood pressure, heart failure, and kidney disease.  ACE inhibitors are generally well-tolerated, but they can cause side effects such as dizziness, fatigue, and coughing. They can also interact with other medications, so it is important to talk to your doctor before taking an ACE inhibitor.</p>
