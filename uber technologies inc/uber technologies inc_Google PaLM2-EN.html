<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p id='aitext'> Uber Technologies Inc. is an American multinational ride-hailing company headquartered in San Francisco, California. The company provides technology that connects users with drivers of vehicles for hire, food delivery, and other services. Uber was founded in 2009 by Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp.  Uber's business model is based on a commission system, where the company takes a percentage of each fare. The company also charges a cancellation fee if a user cancels a ride after a certain amount of time. Uber has been criticized for its treatment of drivers, who are considered independent contractors and are not entitled to benefits such as health insurance or paid time off.  Despite these criticisms, Uber has grown rapidly in recent years. The company is now operating in over 60 countries and has a market capitalization of over $100 billion. Uber is one of the most valuable private companies in the world.  In addition to its ride-hailing business, Uber also offers food delivery services through Uber Eats and freight transportation services through Uber Freight. The company is also developing self-driving cars, which it hopes will eventually replace human drivers.  Uber is a controversial company, but there is no doubt that it has changed the way people travel. The company has made it easier and more convenient for people to get around, and it has also created new opportunities for drivers and other workers.</p>
