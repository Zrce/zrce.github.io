<p> Burger King is a global fast food restaurant chain headquartered in Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States. The company was founded in 1953 as Insta-Burger King, a Jacksonville, Florida-based restaurant chain. After Insta-Burger King ran into financial difficulties, its two Miami-based franchisees David Edgerton and James McLamore purchased the company and renamed it Burger King in 1954.  Burger King is the second-largest fast food hamburger chain in the world, after McDonald's. As of December 31, 2018, the company had 17,796 restaurants in 100 countries and U.S. territories. Burger King's primary products are hamburgers, cheeseburgers, french fries, onion rings, soft drinks, milkshakes, and desserts. The company also offers a variety of other menu items, including salads, wraps, and chicken sandwiches.
