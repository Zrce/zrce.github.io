<p> The S端ddeutsche Zeitung (SZ) is a German daily newspaper based in Munich, Bavaria. It is the largest subscription newspaper in Germany and one of the most widely read newspapers in the country. The SZ is known for its high-quality journalism and its in-depth coverage of current affairs, politics, business, and culture.  The newspaper was founded in 1945 by a group of journalists who had previously worked for the M端nchner Neueste Nachrichten, which had been shut down by the Nazi regime. The SZ quickly established itself as a leading voice in German journalism and has since become one of the most influential newspapers in the country.  The SZ is published six days a week and has a circulation of over 400,000 copies. The newspaper is also available online and has a strong presence on social media.  The SZ is owned by the S端ddeutscher Verlag, a media company that also publishes several other newspapers and magazines. The S端ddeutscher Verlag is in turn owned by the WAZ-Mediengruppe, one of the largest media companies in Germany.  The SZ is a member of the European Newspaper Publishers' Association (ENPA) and the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers (WAN-IFRA).</p>
