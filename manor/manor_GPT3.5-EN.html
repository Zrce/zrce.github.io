<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p>A manor is a large country house or estate, typically owned by a wealthy individual or family. It is often associated with the feudal system in medieval Europe, where the lord of the manor held authority over the surrounding lands and the peasants who lived and worked on them. Manors were self-sufficient communities with agricultural lands, a manor house, and various buildings for different purposes. Today, the term "manor" is sometimes used to refer to any large and impressive residence, regardless of its historical context.</p>
