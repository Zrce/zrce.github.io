<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p id='aitext'> A manor is a large country house with lands, or an estate. The term originally referred to a landed estate in the European feudal system, held by a lord or other noble who granted land to vassals in return for military service and other obligations. Over time, the term came to refer to the main house on such an estate, and eventually to any large country house.  Manors typically have a long history and are often associated with wealthy families or individuals. They may be surrounded by extensive gardens, parkland, and other agricultural land. Many manors have been converted into hotels, wedding venues, or other commercial uses, while others remain private residences.  Here are some key characteristics of a manor:  * A large country house, often with a long history * Associated with wealthy families or individuals * Surrounded by extensive gardens, parkland, and other agricultural land * May have been converted into a hotel, wedding venue, or other commercial use * Often has a unique architectural style, such as Tudor, Georgian, or Victorian</p>
