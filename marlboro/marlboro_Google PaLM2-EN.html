<p class='aitext'> **Marlboro** is a brand of cigarettes manufactured by Philip Morris International. It is the best-selling cigarette brand in the world. Marlboro was first introduced in 1924 as a women's cigarette, but it was later rebranded as a men's cigarette in the 1950s. The brand is known for its iconic red and white packaging and its use of the Marlboro Man in its advertising campaigns.  Marlboro cigarettes are made from a blend of tobaccos, including Virginia, Burley, and Oriental tobaccos. The cigarettes are available in a variety of flavors, including regular, menthol, and light. Marlboro also produces a variety of other tobacco products, including cigars, pipe tobacco, and smokeless tobacco.  Marlboro is a global brand that is sold in over 180 countries. The brand is particularly popular in the United States, where it holds a market share of over 40%. Marlboro is also a popular brand in Europe, Asia, and Latin America.  The Marlboro brand has been the subject of much controversy over the years. Critics have accused Philip Morris International of targeting young people with its advertising campaigns and of contributing to the high rates of smoking-related deaths. However, Philip Morris International has defended its marketing practices and has argued that smoking is a personal choice.  Despite the controversy, Marlboro remains one of the most popular cigarette brands in the world. The brand is a symbol of American culture and has been featured in numerous movies, TV shows, and books.</p>
