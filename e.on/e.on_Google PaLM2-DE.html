<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p> E.ON is a German multinational energy company headquartered in Essen, Germany. It is one of the largest energy companies in the world, with operations in over 30 countries. E.ON generates, distributes, and sells electricity, gas, and heat. The company also provides energy-related services, such as energy efficiency consulting and renewable energy development.  E.ON was founded in 1999 through the merger of two German energy companies, VEBA and VIAG. The company has since grown through a series of acquisitions, including the purchase of the British energy company Powergen in 2001 and the Spanish energy company Endesa in 2007.  E.ON is a publicly traded company, and its shares are listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. The company is majority-owned by the German government, which holds a 30% stake.  E.ON has been criticized for its environmental record, particularly its reliance on fossil fuels. However, the company has committed to reducing its carbon emissions and investing in renewable energy.  In 2020, E.ON announced plans to split into two companies: one focused on renewable energy and the other on traditional energy sources. The split is expected to be completed in 2023.</p>
