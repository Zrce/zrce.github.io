<p id='aitext'> Frankfurt Airport (IATA: FRA, ICAO: EDDF), also known as Rhein-Main-Flughafen, is the largest airport in Germany by passenger traffic and cargo throughput. It is located in the state of Hesse, approximately 12 km (7.5 mi) southwest of the city center of Frankfurt. The airport serves as a major hub for Lufthansa, Germany's flag carrier, and is a significant cargo hub for Europe.  Frankfurt Airport has two passenger terminals, Terminal 1 and Terminal 2, which are connected by an underground railway system called the SkyLine. Terminal 1 is the older of the two and primarily handles domestic and European flights, while Terminal 2 is newer and serves long-haul international flights.
