<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p> ADP (adenosine diphosphate) is a molecule that plays a central role in cellular energy metabolism. It is composed of an adenine molecule attached to a ribose sugar molecule, which is in turn attached to two phosphate groups. ADP is formed when ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the cell's main energy currency, loses one of its phosphate groups.  ADP is involved in a number of cellular processes, including:  * **Energy production:** ADP is converted back into ATP through the process of oxidative phosphorylation, which occurs in the mitochondria. During oxidative phosphorylation, electrons are transferred through the electron transport chain, and the energy released from this process is used to phosphorylate ADP, converting it into ATP. * **Muscle contraction:** ADP is also involved in muscle contraction. When a muscle contracts, ATP is broken down into ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi). The ADP then binds to actin and myosin, two proteins that are involved in muscle contraction. This binding causes a conformational change in the proteins, which leads to muscle contraction. * **Signal transduction:** ADP is also involved in signal transduction, which is the process by which cells communicate with each other. When a signal molecule binds to a receptor on the cell surface, it can trigger a cascade of events that leads to the production of ADP. ADP then binds to proteins that are involved in signal transduction, and this binding can lead to changes in gene expression and other cellular processes.  ADP is a critical molecule for cellular energy metabolism and is involved in a number of important cellular processes.</p>
