<p> Wuliangye is a brand of Chinese baijiu, a distilled alcoholic beverage made from fermented sorghum. It is produced in the city of Yibin, Sichuan province, China. Wuliangye is one of the most popular and well-known brands of baijiu in China, and is also exported to other countries around the world.  Wuliangye is made using a traditional brewing process that has been passed down through generations. The sorghum is first fermented with yeast, and then distilled to produce a clear spirit. The spirit is then aged in clay pots for several years, which gives it its characteristic flavor and aroma.  Wuliangye is typically drunk neat, but can also be mixed with other beverages, such as tea or fruit juice. It is often served at special occasions, such as weddings and banquets.
