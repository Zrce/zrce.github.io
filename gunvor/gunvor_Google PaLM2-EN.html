<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p> Gunvor is a privately held energy trading company founded in 2000 and headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. It is one of the world's largest independent crude oil traders and also trades in refined products, natural gas, and power. Gunvor has offices in over 20 countries and employs over 1,600 people.  The company was founded by Gennady Timchenko, a Russian businessman who was close to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Timchenko sold his stake in Gunvor in 2014 after he was sanctioned by the United States and the European Union in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea.  Gunvor has been involved in a number of controversies over the years, including allegations of corruption and money laundering. However, the company has denied any wrongdoing and has said that it operates in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.  In 2022, Gunvor announced that it would be exiting the Russian market after the country's invasion of Ukraine. The company said that it would continue to operate in other parts of the world.</p>
