<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p class='aitext'> Gunvor is a privately held international energy trading company headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. It is one of the world's largest independent crude oil traders and also trades in refined products, natural gas, and power. Gunvor was founded in 2000 by Gennady Timchenko and Torbjörn Törnqvist. The company has offices in over 30 countries and employs over 1,600 people.  Gunvor's main business is the trading of crude oil and refined products. The company sources crude oil from producers around the world and sells it to refineries and other end users. Gunvor also trades in refined products, such as gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. The company's natural gas and power trading activities are relatively small compared to its oil trading business.  Gunvor has been involved in a number of controversies over the years. In 2012, the company was accused of bribing government officials in Ecuador in order to secure oil contracts. Gunvor denied the allegations and was eventually cleared of any wrongdoing. In 2014, the company was again accused of corruption, this time in connection with its dealings in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Gunvor denied the allegations and is currently under investigation by the Swiss authorities.  Despite the controversies, Gunvor remains one of the world's largest and most successful energy trading companies. The company has a strong track record of profitability and has been able to weather the ups and downs of the oil market. Gunvor is well-positioned to continue to grow its business in the years to come.</p>
