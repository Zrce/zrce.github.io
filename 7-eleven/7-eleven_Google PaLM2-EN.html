<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p class='aitext'> 7-Eleven is an international chain of convenience stores, headquartered in Irving, Texas. It is the largest chain of convenience stores in the United States and Canada, and the second-largest in the world behind Circle K. 7-Eleven stores are typically open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and offer a variety of convenience items, including food, drinks, snacks, and household products. The company was founded in 1927 in Dallas, Texas, by Joe C. Thompson and his partner, John Jefferson Green. The name "7-Eleven" comes from the stores' original operating hours, which were from 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. 7-Eleven has since expanded its hours of operation to 24 hours a day, and the company now has over 68,000 stores in 18 countries.</p>
