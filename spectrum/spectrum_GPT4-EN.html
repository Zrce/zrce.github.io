<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p id='aitext'>Spectrum can refer to several different concepts depending on the context:  1. In physics, a spectrum is a range of wavelengths or frequencies of electromagnetic radiation. This includes the visible light spectrum, which ranges from red to violet, as well as other types of light that are not visible to the human eye, such as ultraviolet and infrared light.  2. In telecommunications, spectrum refers to the range of radio frequencies used to transmit sound, data, and video across a country. It is divided into bands to prevent interference between different types of services.  3. In medicine and psychology, a spectrum often refers to a range of symptoms, behaviors, or characteristics that can occur in a disorder or condition. For example, the autism spectrum includes a range of symptoms and behaviors that can vary widely in severity.  4. In mathematics, the spectrum of a matrix is the set of its eigenvalues.  5. Spectrum can also refer to a broad range of varied but related ideas or objects, the individual features of which tend to overlap to form a continuous series or sequence.</p>
