<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p> Pepsi is a carbonated soft drink sold in stores, restaurants, and vending machines throughout the world. It is produced by PepsiCo, which is headquartered in Purchase, New York, United States. Pepsi is the second-best-selling soft drink in the world, after Coca-Cola.  Pepsi was invented in 1893 by Caleb Bradham, a pharmacist from New Bern, North Carolina. Bradham was looking for a new drink that would help with digestion and headaches. He experimented with different ingredients, including kola nuts, sugar, water, and vanilla extract. He eventually came up with a drink that he called "Brad's Drink."  In 1898, Bradham changed the name of his drink to "Pepsi-Cola." He believed that the name would be more appealing to consumers. Pepsi-Cola quickly became popular, and it was soon being sold in stores and restaurants throughout the United States.  In 1902, Bradham incorporated the Pepsi-Cola Company. The company continued to grow, and it eventually became one of the largest soft drink companies in the world. In 1965, Pepsi-Cola merged with Frito-Lay to form PepsiCo.  Today, Pepsi is sold in more than 200 countries around the world. It is available in a variety of flavors, including regular, diet, and caffeine-free. Pepsi is also used as an ingredient in a variety of other products, such as ice cream, candy, and baked goods.  Pepsi is a global brand that is recognized by people all over the world. It is a symbol of American culture and capitalism. Pepsi is also a reminder of the ingenuity and creativity of Caleb Bradham, the man who invented it.</p>
