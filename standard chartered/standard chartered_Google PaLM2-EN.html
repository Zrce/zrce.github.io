<p id='aitext'> Standard Chartered is a British multinational banking and financial services company headquartered in London, United Kingdom. It is a universal bank with operations in more than 60 countries and territories, and is listed on the London Stock Exchange and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.  Standard Chartered was founded in 1853 as the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China. It was formed by a group of British businessmen who wanted to establish a bank that would finance trade between Britain and its colonies in Asia. The bank's name was changed to Standard Chartered Bank in 1969.  Standard Chartered is one of the largest banks in the world, with total assets of over $1 trillion. It provides a wide range of banking and financial services, including personal banking, corporate banking, investment banking, and private banking. The bank also has a strong presence in emerging markets, where it is a leading provider of financial services to businesses and individuals.  Standard Chartered has been criticized for its involvement in controversial activities, such as financing the arms trade and supporting oppressive regimes. However, the bank has also been praised for its work in promoting financial inclusion and sustainable development in emerging markets.  In recent years, Standard Chartered has faced a number of challenges, including the global financial crisis, the rise of fintech companies, and increasing competition from other banks. However, the bank has remained resilient and continues to grow its business.</p>
