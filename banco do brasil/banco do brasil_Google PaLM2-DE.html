<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p id='aitext'> Banco do Brasil S.A. (Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈbɐ̃ku du bɾaˈziw], lit. 'Bank of Brazil') is a Brazilian multinational bank headquartered in Brasília, the capital of Brazil. It is the largest bank in Latin America by assets and the second largest in Brazil by market capitalization. Banco do Brasil is a public company, with the Brazilian government holding a majority stake.  The bank was founded in 1808 by Prince Regent John VI of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves, as the Banco do Brasil para o Comércio e Indústria (Bank of Brazil for Commerce and Industry). It was originally established to finance the Portuguese royal family's flight from Portugal to Brazil during the Napoleonic Wars. After Brazil's independence in 1822, the bank became the central bank of the country. In 1964, the bank was privatized and became a commercial bank.  Banco do Brasil has a wide range of products and services, including personal banking, corporate banking, investment banking, and insurance. The bank has a large network of branches and ATMs in Brazil, as well as a presence in several other countries.  Banco do Brasil is a member of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the World Bank Group. The bank is also a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact, a voluntary initiative for businesses to adopt sustainable and responsible practices.</p>
