<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p> MCC stands for Mobile Country Code. It is a three-digit number that identifies the country of origin of a mobile phone number. The MCC is used in conjunction with the Mobile Network Code (MNC) to identify a specific mobile network operator.  The MCC is assigned by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and is based on the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes. For example, the MCC for the United States is 310, and the MCC for the United Kingdom is 234.  The MCC is used by mobile phones to determine which country they are in and to connect to the appropriate mobile network. It is also used by mobile network operators to identify the country of origin of incoming calls and text messages.  Here are some examples of MCCs:  * United States: 310 * United Kingdom: 234 * Canada: 302 * France: 208 * Germany: 262 * Japan: 440 * China: 460 * India: 404  The MCC is an important part of the mobile phone network infrastructure and is used to ensure that mobile phones can connect to the correct network and that calls and text messages are routed correctly.</p>
