<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p class='aitext'> MCC stands for Mobile Country Code. It is a three-digit number that identifies the country of origin of a mobile phone number. The MCC is used in conjunction with the Mobile Network Code (MNC) to identify a specific mobile network operator.  The MCC is assigned by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and is based on the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code. For example, the MCC for the United States is 310, and the MCC for the United Kingdom is 234.  The MCC is used by mobile phones to automatically select the appropriate network operator when roaming. When a mobile phone is in a foreign country, it will search for a network operator that has an agreement with its home network operator. The MCC is used to identify the home network operator of the mobile phone.  The MCC is also used by mobile network operators to track the location of their customers. This information can be used to provide location-based services, such as weather forecasts and traffic updates.  The MCC is an important part of the mobile phone network infrastructure. It allows mobile phones to automatically select the appropriate network operator and provides mobile network operators with information about the location of their customers.</p>
