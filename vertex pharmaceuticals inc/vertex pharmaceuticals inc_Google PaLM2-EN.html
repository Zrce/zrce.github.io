<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p> Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated is an American biopharmaceutical company based in Boston, Massachusetts. The company's focus is on the discovery, development, and commercialization of innovative medicines to treat serious diseases. Vertex is best known for its cystic fibrosis (CF) treatments, including Kalydeco, Orkambi, and Trikafta. These drugs have significantly improved the lives of people with CF by targeting the underlying cause of the disease.  Vertex was founded in 1989 by Joshua Boger, a Harvard University chemistry professor, and three of his former students. The company's early research focused on developing drugs to treat cancer and HIV/AIDS. However, in the mid-1990s, Vertex shifted its focus to CF after identifying a potential drug target for the disease.  Vertex's first CF drug, Kalydeco, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2012. Kalydeco is a breakthrough treatment for people with CF who have a specific genetic mutation. The drug works by correcting the function of the defective protein that causes CF. Kalydeco has been shown to significantly improve lung function and reduce the risk of hospitalization and death in people with CF.  In 2015, Vertex received FDA approval for Orkambi, a combination therapy that includes Kalydeco and a second drug called lumacaftor. Orkambi is indicated for people with CF who have two copies of the F508del mutation, the most common genetic mutation associated with CF. Orkambi has been shown to improve lung function and reduce the risk of hospitalization and death in people with CF who have the F508del mutation.  In 2019, Vertex received FDA approval for Trikafta, a triple-combination therapy that includes Kalydeco, lumacaftor, and a third drug called ivacaftor. Trikafta is indicated for people with CF who have at least one copy of the F508del mutation. Trikafta has been shown to be highly effective in improving lung function and reducing the risk of hospitalization and death in people with CF who have the F508del mutation.  Vertex's CF drugs have been a major breakthrough in the treatment of the disease. These drugs have significantly improved the lives of people with CF and have given them hope for a longer and healthier life. Vertex is continuing to research and develop new treatments for CF and other serious diseases.</p>
