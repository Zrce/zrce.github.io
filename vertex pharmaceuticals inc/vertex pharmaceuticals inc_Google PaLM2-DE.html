<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p class='aitext'> Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated is an American biopharmaceutical company based in Boston, Massachusetts. The company's focus is on the discovery, development, and commercialization of innovative medicines to treat serious diseases. Vertex is best known for its cystic fibrosis (CF) treatments, including Kalydeco, Orkambi, and Trikafta. These drugs have significantly improved the lives of people with CF by targeting the underlying cause of the disease.  Vertex was founded in 1989 by Joshua Boger, a professor at Harvard University. The company's early research focused on developing drugs to treat cancer and HIV/AIDS. However, in the mid-1990s, Vertex shifted its focus to CF after identifying a potential target for drug development.  Vertex's first CF drug, Kalydeco, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2012. Kalydeco is a breakthrough medication that treats the underlying cause of CF in people with specific genetic mutations. The drug has been shown to significantly improve lung function and reduce the risk of hospitalization and death in people with CF.  In 2015, Vertex received FDA approval for Orkambi, a combination therapy that includes Kalydeco and another drug called lumacaftor. Orkambi is indicated for people with CF who have two copies of the F508del mutation, the most common genetic mutation associated with CF. Orkambi has been shown to improve lung function and reduce the risk of hospitalization and death in people with CF.  In 2019, Vertex received FDA approval for Trikafta, a triple-combination therapy that includes Kalydeco, Orkambi, and a third drug called elexacaftor. Trikafta is indicated for people with CF who have at least one copy of the F508del mutation. Trikafta has been shown to be highly effective in improving lung function and reducing the risk of hospitalization and death in people with CF.  Vertex's CF drugs have been a major breakthrough in the treatment of this serious disease. These drugs have significantly improved the lives of people with CF and have given them hope for a longer and healthier life.  In addition to its CF drugs, Vertex is also developing treatments for other serious diseases, including type 1 diabetes, sickle cell disease, and pain. The company has a strong pipeline of potential new drugs and is committed to developing innovative medicines that can make a difference in the lives of patients.</p>
