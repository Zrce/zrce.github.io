<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p class='aitext'> CVS stands for Concurrent Versions System. It is a version control system that allows multiple developers to work on the same files at the same time. CVS keeps track of the changes that each developer makes, and allows them to merge their changes together without conflict.  CVS is a client-server system. The server stores the files that are being worked on, and the clients connect to the server to make changes. CVS uses a branching model, which means that developers can create new branches of the codebase to work on new features or fix bugs.  CVS is a popular version control system, and it is used by many large organizations. However, it is not as popular as it once was, as it has been replaced by newer version control systems such as Git and Subversion.</p>
