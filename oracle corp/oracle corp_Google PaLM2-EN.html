<p class='aitext'> Oracle Corporation is an American multinational computer technology corporation headquartered in Austin, Texas. The company sells database software and technology, cloud engineered systems and software, and enterprise software productsâ€”particularly its own brands of database management systems. In 2020, Oracle was the second-largest software company in the world by revenue and market capitalization.  Oracle was founded in 1977 by Larry Ellison and Bob Miner.

These acquisitions helped Oracle to become a major player in the enterprise software market.  Today, Oracle is one of the largest software companies in the world. The company's products are used by businesses of all sizes, from small businesses to large enterprises. Oracle's products are also used by government agencies and educational institutions.
