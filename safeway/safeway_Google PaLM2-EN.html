Safeway operates over 2,000 stores in 35 states and the District of Columbia. The company is headquartered in Pleasanton, California.  Safeway was founded in 1915 by Marion Barton Skaggs in American Falls, Idaho. The company grew rapidly in the early 20th century, and by the 1950s, it was one of the largest supermarket chains in the United States. Safeway continued to grow in the 1960s and 1970s, and by the 1980s, it was the largest supermarket chain in the United States.
