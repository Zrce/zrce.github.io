<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p id='aitext'> **Roche** is a term used in astronomy to describe the region around a celestial body within which a smaller body, such as a moon or an artificial satellite, can maintain a stable orbit without being pulled away by the gravitational force of another celestial body. This region is named after the French astronomer Ã‰douard Roche, who first described it in 1847.  The Roche limit is determined by the balance between the gravitational forces exerted by the primary body (e.g., a planet) and the secondary body (e.g., a moon). If the secondary body is too close to the primary body, the tidal forces exerted by the primary body will exceed the gravitational force holding the secondary body together, causing it to disintegrate. This is known as the Roche limit for tidal disruption.  On the other hand, if the secondary body is too far from the primary body, the gravitational force of the primary body will be too weak to keep the secondary body in orbit, and it will eventually escape. This is known as the Roche limit for orbital stability.  The Roche limit is an important concept in astrophysics and celestial mechanics, as it helps astronomers understand the dynamics of planetary systems, the formation of moons, and the stability of artificial satellites. It also plays a role in understanding the tidal forces that can affect celestial bodies and the potential for tidal disruption events.</p>
