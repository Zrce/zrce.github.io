<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p> **Roche** is a term used in astronomy to describe the region around a celestial body within which its gravitational pull is greater than that of another nearby body. It is named after the French astronomer Ã‰douard Roche, who first described the concept in the 19th century.  The Roche limit is the distance from a celestial body at which the gravitational forces from that body and another nearby body are equal. Within the Roche limit, the gravitational pull of the primary body is strong enough to hold material together, while beyond the Roche limit, the gravitational pull of the secondary body is stronger and can cause material to break apart.  The Roche limit is important in understanding the formation and evolution of celestial bodies, such as planets, moons, and asteroids. For example, the Roche limit plays a role in the formation of planetary rings, which are composed of material that has been pulled apart by the gravitational forces of the planet and its moons.  The Roche limit can also be used to explain the breakup of comets as they approach the Sun. Comets are composed of ice and dust, and as they get closer to the Sun, the heat from the Sun causes the ice to vaporize and the dust to be blown away by the solar wind. The gravitational forces from the Sun and the comet's nucleus can cause the comet to break apart if it gets too close to the Sun, resulting in a spectacular disintegration of the comet.  The Roche limit is a fundamental concept in astronomy that helps us understand the dynamics of celestial bodies and the processes that shape their evolution.</p>
