It is considered one of the Big Five companies in the U.S. information technology industry, along with Alphabet, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft.  Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos on July 5, 1994, as an online bookstore. It quickly expanded its offerings to include a wide variety of products, including electronics, apparel, furniture, toys, and groceries. Amazon also offers a variety of services, such as Amazon Prime, which provides free two-day shipping and access to streaming movies and TV shows, and Amazon Web Services (AWS), which provides cloud computing services to businesses.  Amazon is the largest online retailer in the world, with an estimated market capitalization of over $1 trillion. It is also the second-largest private employer in the United States, with over 1.3 million employees.  Amazon has been praised for its customer service, innovation, and wide selection of products.
