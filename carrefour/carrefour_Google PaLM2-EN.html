<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p> Carrefour is a French multinational retail corporation headquartered in Boulogne-Billancourt, France. The company operates a chain of hypermarkets, supermarkets, and convenience stores, as well as an e-commerce website. Carrefour is the world's largest hypermarket chain and the second-largest retailer in the world after Walmart.  The company was founded in 1959 by Marcel Fournier and Denis Defforey. Carrefour opened its first hypermarket in Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois, France, in 1963. The company expanded rapidly throughout Europe in the 1970s and 1980s, and it entered the Asian market in the 1990s. Carrefour currently operates stores in over 30 countries around the world.  Carrefour's business model is based on the concept of "hypermarkets," which are large stores that offer a wide variety of products under one roof. Carrefour hypermarkets typically sell groceries, clothing, electronics, furniture, and other household items. The company also operates supermarkets, which are smaller stores that offer a more limited selection of products.  Carrefour has been criticized for its environmental practices, particularly its use of plastic packaging. The company has pledged to reduce its plastic waste by 20% by 2025.  Carrefour is a publicly traded company listed on the Euronext Paris stock exchange. The company's market capitalization is approximately €15 billion.</p>
