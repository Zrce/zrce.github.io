<p class='aitext'> Saudi Aramco, officially the Saudi Arabian Oil Company, is a Saudi Arabian national petroleum and natural gas company based in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. It is the world's largest oil company by crude oil production and the world's most profitable company. Saudi Aramco is also the world's largest exporter of crude oil and a major producer of natural gas.  The company was founded in 1933 as the Arabian American Oil Company (Aramco) by Standard Oil of California (Socal), Texaco, and Standard Oil of New Jersey (Esso). In 1973, the Saudi Arabian government acquired a 25% stake in Aramco, and in 1980, it acquired the remaining 75% stake, making Aramco a fully state-owned company.  Saudi Aramco is responsible for the exploration, production, refining, distribution, and marketing of crude oil and natural gas in Saudi Arabia. The company also operates a number of joint ventures with international oil companies, including Chevron, ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, and TotalEnergies.  Saudi Aramco is a major contributor to the Saudi Arabian economy. The company accounts for approximately 8% of the country's GDP and provides employment for over 70,000 people. Saudi Aramco also plays a key role in the global oil market, and its decisions can have a significant impact on oil prices.
