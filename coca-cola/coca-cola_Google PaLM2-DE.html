<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p> Coca-Cola is a carbonated soft drink sold in stores, restaurants, and vending machines throughout the world. It is produced by The Coca-Cola Company of Atlanta, Georgia. Originally intended as a patent medicine, it was invented in 1886 by Dr. John S. Pemberton, a pharmacist from Atlanta. Pemberton sold his formula to Asa Candler, who marketed the drink as a temperance beverage and made it a national success. Candler's aggressive marketing tactics helped Coca-Cola become the world's most popular soft drink by the 1920s.  Coca-Cola is made with a secret formula that includes carbonated water, sugar, caffeine, phosphoric acid, natural flavors, and caramel color. The exact recipe is known only to a few select executives at The Coca-Cola Company. Coca-Cola is available in a variety of flavors, including original, diet, cherry, vanilla, and zero sugar.  Coca-Cola is one of the most iconic brands in the world. It is sold in over 200 countries and territories, and it is estimated that more than 1.9 billion servings of Coca-Cola are consumed each day. The Coca-Cola Company is one of the largest beverage companies in the world, and it generates billions of dollars in revenue each year.</p>
