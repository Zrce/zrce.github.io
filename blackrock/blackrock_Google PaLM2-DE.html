<p id='aitext'> BlackRock, Inc. is an American multinational investment management corporation based in New York City. Founded in 1988, it is the world's largest asset manager, with over $10 trillion in assets under management as of January 2023. BlackRock offers a wide range of investment products and services to institutional and retail clients, including mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and alternative investments. The company also provides investment advisory and risk management services.  BlackRock was founded by Laurence D. Fink, Robert S. Kapito, and Susan Wagner. The company has grown rapidly over the years, thanks in part to its acquisition of several other asset management firms, including Merrill Lynch Investment Managers in 2006 and Barclays Global Investors in 2009.  BlackRock is a publicly traded company, and its shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The company is headquartered in New York City, but it also has offices in over 30 countries around the world.  BlackRock has been criticized for its size and influence in the financial markets. Some critics argue that the company is too big and that it has too much power over the global economy. Others argue that BlackRock's investment strategies are too risky and that they could lead to another financial crisis.  Despite these criticisms, BlackRock remains one of the most powerful and influential companies in the financial world. The company's size and scale give it a unique ability to shape the global economy, and its investment decisions can have a significant impact on the performance of financial markets.</p>
