<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p>Woolworths is a major Australian supermarket and retail chain. It is one of the largest companies in Australia and is also the second largest in New Zealand. Woolworths specializes in groceries (vegetables, fruit, meat, packaged foods, etc.), but also offers magazines, DVDs, health and beauty products, household products, pet and baby supplies, and stationery items. It should not be confused with the defunct American company, F. W. Woolworth Company, or the unrelated UK retail company, Woolworths Group.</p>
