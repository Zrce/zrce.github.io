<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p> CDW stands for Collision Damage Waiver. It is an optional insurance coverage that can be purchased when renting a car. CDW waives the renter's financial responsibility for damage to the rental car caused by a collision, regardless of who is at fault.  CDW is not required by law, but it is highly recommended. If you do not purchase CDW, you will be responsible for paying for any damage to the rental car, even if it is not your fault.  The cost of CDW varies depending on the rental company and the type of car you are renting. It is typically around $10-$20 per day.  If you are considering renting a car, it is important to weigh the cost of CDW against the risk of damage to the rental car. If you are a safe driver and you are confident that you will not damage the car, you may decide to skip CDW. However, if you are concerned about the possibility of damage, it is worth the peace of mind to purchase CDW.</p>
