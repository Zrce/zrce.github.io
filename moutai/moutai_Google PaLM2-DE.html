<p id='aitext'> Moutai (茅台酒) is a renowned Chinese distilled alcoholic beverage produced in the town of Maotai, Guizhou province, China. It is a type of baijiu, a clear spirit made from fermented sorghum grains. Moutai is considered one of the most famous and prestigious baijiu brands in China and is often referred to as the "national drink" of the country.  Moutai has a long history dating back over 2,000 years. It is believed to have originated during the Western Han Dynasty (206 BC - 24 AD) and has been produced in the Maotai region ever since. The unique climate, water source, and soil conditions in Maotai are said to contribute to the distinctive flavor and aroma of Moutai.  The production process of Moutai is complex and involves multiple stages of fermentation, distillation, and aging. The sorghum grains are first steamed and then fermented with a special yeast culture called "Daqu." The fermented grains are then distilled multiple times to produce a high-proof spirit. The resulting spirit is then aged in ceramic pots for several years, which mellows the flavor and develops its complexity.  Moutai is known for its strong, distinct aroma and smooth, full-bodied taste. It has a high alcohol content, typically ranging from 53% to 56% ABV. Moutai is often served at special occasions, banquets, and business gatherings in China and is considered a symbol of prestige and hospitality.  Due to its popularity and limited production, Moutai can be quite expensive, especially for older vintages. It is often regarded as a luxury item and is sometimes used as a gift or investment. Moutai has gained international recognition and is exported to various countries around the world.</p>
