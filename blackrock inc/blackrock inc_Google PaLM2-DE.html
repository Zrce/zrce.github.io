The company also provides risk management, advisory, and technology services to clients.  BlackRock was founded by Laurence D. Fink, Robert S. Kapito, and Susan Wagner. The company has grown rapidly over the years through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. In 2009, BlackRock acquired Barclays Global Investors, which was then the world's largest asset manager. This acquisition made BlackRock the world's largest asset manager.  BlackRock is a publicly traded company and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "BLK." The company has a market capitalization of over $100 billion.  BlackRock has been criticized for its size and influence in the financial markets. Some critics argue that the company is too big and that it has too much power over the financial system. Others argue that BlackRock's investment strategies are too risky and that they could lead to a financial crisis.
