<p id='aitext'> CPIC stands for Clinical Practice Improvement Collaborative. It is a program that helps healthcare organizations improve the quality of care they provide to patients. CPICs are typically led by a team of experts in healthcare quality improvement, and they work with healthcare organizations to identify areas where improvements can be made. CPICs then develop and implement strategies to improve care, and they track the progress of these strategies over time.  CPICs have been shown to be effective in improving the quality of care in a variety of healthcare settings. For example, CPICs have been shown to reduce the rates of hospital-acquired infections, improve patient safety, and increase patient satisfaction.  CPICs are a valuable tool for healthcare organizations that are committed to providing high-quality care to their patients. By working with CPICs, healthcare organizations can identify areas where improvements can be made, develop and implement strategies to improve care, and track the progress of these strategies over time.</p>
