<p id='aitext'> Nestlé is a Swiss multinational food and drink company headquartered in Vevey, Vaud, Switzerland. It is the largest food company in the world measured by revenue and other metrics, and has been listed on the Swiss Stock Exchange since 1927. Nestlé's products include a wide range of foods and beverages, including coffee, tea, bottled water, chocolate, confectionery, dairy products, infant formula, and pet food. The company has over 2,000 factories, operates in 189 countries, and employs around 339,000 people. Nestlé was founded in 1866 by Henri Nestlé, a German-born pharmacist who developed a milk-based baby food formula. The company grew rapidly in the early 20th century through acquisitions and mergers, and by the 1950s had become one of the largest food companies in the world. Nestlé has continued to grow and expand in recent decades, and today is a global leader in the food and beverage industry.</p>
