<p id='aitext'>Tesla, Inc. is an American electric vehicle and clean energy company founded by Elon Musk, JB Straubel, Martin Eberhard, Marc Tarpenning, and Ian Wright in 2003. The company is named after the renowned physicist and electrical engineer, Nikola Tesla. Tesla primarily focuses on the production of electric vehicles (EVs), energy storage solutions, and renewable energy generation.  Tesla is known for its innovative and technologically advanced electric cars, including models like the Tesla Model S, Model 3, Model X, and Model Y. These vehicles are powered by rechargeable lithium-ion battery packs, which provide longer ranges and lower emissions compared to traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.  In addition to electric vehicles, Tesla also manufactures energy storage products like the Powerwall and Powerpack, which are designed to store electricity generated from renewable sources like solar and wind. These energy storage solutions enable homes, businesses, and utilities to store excess energy for later use, reducing reliance on the grid and promoting sustainability.  Furthermore, Tesla is involved in the development and deployment of solar energy systems through its subsidiary, SolarCity. The company offers solar panels and solar roof tiles, allowing customers to generate their own clean energy and reduce their carbon footprint.  Tesla's mission is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy by providing innovative and high-quality products that promote the adoption of electric vehicles and renewable energy sources.</p>
