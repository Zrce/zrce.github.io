<p class='aitext'> Trivago is a hotel search website and travel metasearch engine that compares prices from multiple online travel agencies and hotels. It was founded in 2005 in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany, and is currently headquartered in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Trivago allows users to search for hotels by location, price, amenities, and other criteria. It also provides users with reviews and ratings from other travelers. Trivago is available in over 50 countries and 33 languages.  Trivago makes money through affiliate marketing. When a user clicks on a hotel link on Trivago and books a room, Trivago receives a commission from the hotel or online travel agency. Trivago does not charge users any fees for using its website.  Trivago has been criticized for its business practices, including its use of paid advertising and its lack of transparency about how it ranks hotels. However, it remains one of the most popular hotel search websites in the world.</p>
