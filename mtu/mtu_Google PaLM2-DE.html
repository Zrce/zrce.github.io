<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p> MTU stands for Maximum Transmission Unit. It refers to the largest size of a data packet that can be transmitted over a network without being fragmented. Fragmentation occurs when a packet is too large to fit within the maximum transmission unit of the network interface it is being sent through. When a packet is fragmented, it is broken up into smaller pieces, each of which is then sent separately. This can lead to increased latency and reduced throughput, as the fragments must be reassembled at the receiving end.  The MTU of a network interface is typically determined by the physical layer protocol being used. For example, the MTU for Ethernet is typically 1500 bytes, while the MTU for PPP is typically 576 bytes. However, the MTU can also be configured manually, if necessary.  It is important to note that the MTU of a network interface must be the same as the MTU of the network device it is connected to. If the MTUs are different, packets may be fragmented, which can lead to performance problems.</p>
