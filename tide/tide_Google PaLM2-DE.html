<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p> Tide is the periodic rise and fall of sea levels caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and sun. The moon's gravitational pull is the primary force that generates tides, with the sun's influence being about 40% of the moon's.  Tides occur because the Earth, moon, and sun are not perfectly aligned. The moon's gravity exerts a stronger pull on the side of the Earth facing it, causing the water in the oceans to bulge out in that direction. On the opposite side of the Earth, the water also bulges out, away from the moon. These two bulges of water are high tides.  The Earth rotates on its axis once a day, so the different parts of the Earth move through the moon's gravitational field. This causes the tides to rise and recede twice a day.  The sun's gravity also contributes to tides, but its effect is less than that of the moon. The sun's gravitational pull is strongest during the new moon and full moon, when the sun, Earth, and moon are aligned. During these times, the tides are higher than average. The tides are lower than average during the first quarter and third quarter moons, when the sun and moon are at right angles to each other.  The height of the tides also varies depending on the shape of the coastline and the depth of the water. In some places, tides can be as high as 50 feet, while in other places they may only be a few inches.  Tides are an important part of the Earth's ecosystem. They help to mix the ocean water and distribute nutrients, which supports marine life. Tides also create currents that help to transport heat around the globe.</p>
