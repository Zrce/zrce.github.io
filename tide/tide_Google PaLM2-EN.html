<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p class='aitext'> Tide is the periodic rise and fall of sea levels caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and sun. The moon's gravitational pull is the primary force that generates tides, with the sun's influence being about 40% of the moon's.  Tides occur because the Earth, moon, and sun are not perfectly aligned. The moon's gravity pulls on the Earth's oceans, causing them to bulge out on the side of the Earth facing the moon. This creates a high tide. On the opposite side of the Earth, the water also bulges out, away from the moon, creating another high tide.  The sun's gravity also pulls on the Earth's oceans, but its effect is less than that of the moon. The sun's gravity creates two additional bulges in the oceans, but they are smaller than the bulges created by the moon.  The combined effect of the moon's and sun's gravity creates the tides that we experience on Earth. The tides rise and fall twice a day, with the highest tides occurring when the moon and sun are aligned with the Earth (spring tides) and the lowest tides occurring when the moon and sun are at right angles to the Earth (neap tides).  Tides are an important part of the Earth's ecosystem. They help to mix the ocean's waters, which distributes nutrients and oxygen throughout the ocean. Tides also create currents that transport heat and nutrients around the globe.</p>
