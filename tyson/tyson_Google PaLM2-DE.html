<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p class='aitext'> **Tyson** is a common name for several species of pigeons, including:  * **Common wood pigeon** (_Columba palumbus_) * **European turtle dove** (_Streptopelia turtur_) * **Oriental turtle dove** (_Streptopelia orientalis_) * **Laughing dove** (_Streptopelia senegalensis_) * **Ring-necked dove** (_Streptopelia capicola_)  These birds are all members of the family Columbidae, which also includes doves. Pigeons are typically larger than doves, with longer tails and wings. They are also more social, often living in flocks.  Pigeons are found all over the world, in a variety of habitats. They are most commonly found in forests, but they can also be found in grasslands, deserts, and even urban areas.  Pigeons are omnivores, and their diet consists of a variety of plant matter, including seeds, fruits, and leaves. They also eat insects and other small animals.  Pigeons are monogamous, and they typically mate for life. They build nests in trees or on buildings, and they lay two eggs at a time. The eggs are incubated by both parents, and the chicks hatch after about 18 days.  Pigeons are important members of the ecosystem. They help to disperse seeds, and they provide food for other animals. They are also a popular source of food for humans.  In addition to their ecological importance, pigeons have also played a significant role in human culture. They have been used as symbols of peace and love, and they have been featured in art, literature, and music.</p>
