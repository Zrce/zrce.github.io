<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p id='aitext'> Hennessy is a cognac, a type of brandy produced in the Cognac region of France. It is made from distilled white wine and aged in oak barrels. Hennessy is one of the most famous and prestigious cognac brands in the world, and is known for its smooth, complex flavor. The company was founded in 1765 by Richard Hennessy, an Irish soldier who settled in Cognac. Hennessy cognac is made from a blend of grapes grown in the Cognac region, including Ugni Blanc, Folle Blanche, and Colombard. The grapes are harvested in the fall and then fermented to produce a white wine. The wine is then distilled twice, and the resulting spirit is aged in oak barrels for at least two years. Hennessy cognac is typically aged for much longer, with some barrels being aged for up to 100 years. The aging process gives Hennessy cognac its characteristic flavor and complexity. Hennessy cognac is typically enjoyed neat, or on the rocks. It can also be used in cocktails, such as the Sidecar and the French 75.</p>
