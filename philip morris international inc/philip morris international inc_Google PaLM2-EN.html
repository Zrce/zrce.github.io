<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p id='aitext'> **Philip Morris International Inc.** (PMI) is a leading international tobacco company. It is the parent company of several cigarette and tobacco brands, including Marlboro, L&M, Chesterfield, and Parliament. PMI is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland, and employs over 80,000 people worldwide.  PMI was founded in 1847 by Philip Morris, a London tobacconist. The company initially focused on the production and sale of cigarettes in the United Kingdom. In the early 20th century, PMI began to expand its operations internationally, and by the 1950s, it had become one of the largest tobacco companies in the world.  Today, PMI is a global leader in the tobacco industry. The company's products are sold in over 180 countries, and it has a market share of approximately 15% of the global cigarette market. PMI is also a major player in the e-cigarette market, and it is currently developing a range of new tobacco products, such as heated tobacco products and nicotine pouches.  PMI has been criticized for its role in the tobacco industry, which has been linked to a number of health problems, including cancer, heart disease, and stroke. However, the company has also been praised for its efforts to reduce the harm caused by smoking, such as its development of reduced-risk tobacco products and its support for smoking cessation programs.  PMI is a controversial company, but it is also a major player in the global economy. The company's products are used by millions of people around the world, and it generates billions of dollars in revenue each year. PMI is likely to continue to be a major force in the tobacco industry for many years to come.</p>
