<p id='aitext'> Activision Blizzard, Inc. is an American video game holding company based in Santa Monica, California. It was formed on July 10, 2008, through the merger of Activision, Inc. and Vivendi Games. Activision Blizzard is the world's largest video game publisher by revenue, and it is the parent company of several well-known video game studios, including Activision, Blizzard Entertainment, King, and Infinity Ward.  Activision Blizzard's games include some of the most popular franchises in the world, such as Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Candy Crush Saga, and Diablo. The company also owns several esports leagues, including the Call of Duty League and the Overwatch League.  In recent years, Activision Blizzard has been embroiled in several controversies, including allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination. In July 2021, the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing filed a lawsuit against Activision Blizzard, alleging that the company had created a "hostile work environment" for women and minorities. The lawsuit has led to several high-profile departures from the company, including CEO Bobby Kotick.  Despite the controversies, Activision Blizzard remains a major player in the video game industry. The company's games continue to be popular with consumers, and it is still one of the most profitable companies in the world.</p>
