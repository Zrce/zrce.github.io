<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p class='aitext'> Anthem is a novel by Ayn Rand, first published in 1938. The novel presents Rand's philosophy of Objectivism, which advocates for individual rights and free markets. The story is set in a dystopian future where the government has taken control of all aspects of life, including the economy, the media, and even personal relationships. The protagonist, Equality 7-2521, is a young man who rebels against the government and discovers the power of individualism.  The novel is divided into three parts. The first part, "Equality 7-2521," introduces the protagonist and his life in the dystopian society. The second part, "The Golden One," tells the story of Equality 7-2521's rebellion against the government and his discovery of the power of individualism. The third part, "Anthem," is a collection of speeches and essays by Equality 7-2521 that expound on his philosophy of Objectivism.  Anthem has been praised for its powerful message of individualism and its insights into the dangers of collectivism. However, it has also been criticized for its simplistic portrayal of human nature and its lack of nuance. Despite these criticisms, Anthem remains a popular and influential work of literature.</p>
