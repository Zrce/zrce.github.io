<p class='aitext'> Jean Piaget was a Swiss psychologist who developed a theory of cognitive development that describes how children's minds develop as they grow. Piaget's theory is based on the idea that children's thinking is qualitatively different from adults' thinking and that it goes through a series of distinct stages as they mature.  Piaget's theory of cognitive development is based on the idea that children's minds are not simply smaller versions of adult minds. Rather, they are qualitatively different, and they go through a series of distinct stages as they develop. Piaget identified four main stages of cognitive development:  * **Sensorimotor stage (birth to 2 years):** During this stage, children learn about the world through their senses and motor skills. They explore their environment by touching, tasting, smelling, and listening to everything they can get their hands on. They also learn to coordinate their actions, such as reaching for objects and crawling. * **Preoperational stage (2 to 7 years):** During this stage, children begin to use language and symbols to represent their thoughts. They can think about things that are not present in their immediate environment, and they can start to understand the concept of cause and effect. However, their thinking is still egocentric, meaning that they see the world from their own perspective and have difficulty understanding the perspectives of others. * **Concrete operational stage (7 to 11 years):** During this stage, children become more logical and able to think about things concretely. They can understand the concept of conservation, which means that they know that the amount of liquid in a container remains the same even if the shape of the container changes. They also become more social and able to cooperate with others. * **Formal operational stage (11 years and up):** During this stage, children develop the ability to think abstractly and reason about hypothetical situations. They can also think about the future and make plans for their lives.  Piaget's theory of cognitive development has been influential in the field of psychology, and it has helped to shape our understanding of how children learn and develop.</p>
