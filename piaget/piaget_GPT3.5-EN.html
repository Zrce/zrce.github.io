<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p class='aitext'>Piaget refers to Jean Piaget, a Swiss psychologist known for his work in the field of cognitive development. He proposed a theory of cognitive development that describes how children's thinking evolves as they grow and interact with the world around them. Piaget's theory suggests that children go through four stages of cognitive development: sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational. He believed that children actively construct their understanding of the world through their experiences and interactions, and that their thinking becomes more complex and sophisticated as they progress through these stages. Piaget's work has had a significant impact on the field of developmental psychology and education.</p>
