<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p> The sky is the region of the Earth's atmosphere that is above the surface of the Earth. It is composed of a mixture of gases, including nitrogen, oxygen, argon, and carbon dioxide. The sky appears blue during the day because of the scattering of sunlight by molecules in the atmosphere. At night, the sky appears black because there is no sunlight to scatter.  The sky is an important part of the Earth's climate system. It helps to regulate the temperature of the Earth by absorbing and reflecting sunlight. The sky also plays a role in the water cycle by absorbing and releasing water vapor.  The sky has been a source of inspiration for artists, writers, and musicians for centuries. It has been depicted in paintings, sculptures, poems, and songs. The sky is also a popular subject for photography and astronomy.</p>
