<p class='aitext'> Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is a medical device company that designs, manufactures, and markets robotic surgical systems. The company's flagship product is the da Vinci Surgical System, which is used in a variety of surgical procedures, including general surgery, urology, gynecology, and thoracic surgery. The da Vinci System consists of a surgeon console, a patient-side cart, and a vision cart. The surgeon console allows the surgeon to control the robotic arms of the patient-side cart, which are inserted into the patient's body through small incisions. The vision cart provides the surgeon with a 3D view of the surgical site.  Intuitive Surgical was founded in 1995 by Frederic Moll, a Stanford University professor of computer science, and Phillip Green, a Stanford University professor of surgery. The company is headquartered in Sunnyvale, California. Intuitive Surgical's products are sold in over 60 countries.  The da Vinci Surgical System has been used in over 5 million surgical procedures worldwide. The system has been shown to offer a number of benefits over traditional open surgery, including reduced pain, scarring, and recovery time. The da Vinci System is also associated with a lower risk of complications.  Intuitive Surgical is a publicly traded company. The company's stock is traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol ISRG.</p>
