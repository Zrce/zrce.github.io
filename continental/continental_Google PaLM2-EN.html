<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p class='aitext'> Continental is a term used to describe something related to a continent or continents. It can be used in various contexts, including:  1. **Continental Climate**: Refers to the climate of regions located in the interior of continents, away from the moderating influence of oceans. Continental climates are characterized by large temperature variations between seasons, with hot summers and cold winters.  2. **Continental Drift**: A theory in geology that explains the movement of Earth's continents over time. Continental drift suggests that the continents were once part of a single landmass called Pangaea, which gradually split apart and drifted to their current positions.  3. **Continental Crust**: The outermost layer of Earth's crust that forms the continents. Continental crust is thicker and less dense than oceanic crust and is composed primarily of igneous and metamorphic rocks.  4. **Continental Divide**: A geographical boundary that separates watersheds that drain into different oceans or seas. The continental divide in North America, for example, separates the watersheds that drain into the Atlantic Ocean from those that drain into the Pacific Ocean.  5. **Continental Shelf**: The gently sloping underwater extension of a continent that extends from the shoreline to the continental slope. Continental shelves are typically shallow and are important fishing grounds and sites for offshore oil and gas exploration.  6. **Continental Breakfast**: A type of breakfast commonly served in hotels and guesthouses, typically consisting of coffee or tea, pastries, bread, butter, jam, and fruit.  7. **Continental Airlines**: A former major airline in the United States that operated from 1934 to 2012. Continental Airlines merged with United Airlines in 2010.  These are just a few examples of the various contexts in which the term "continental" is used.</p>
