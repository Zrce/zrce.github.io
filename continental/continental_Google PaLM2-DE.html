<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p class='aitext'> Continental is a term used to describe something related to a continent. It can be used in various contexts, including:  1. **Continental Climate**: A continental climate is characterized by large temperature variations between summer and winter. It is typically found in the interior of continents, away from the moderating influence of oceans. Continental climates are often associated with hot summers and cold winters.  2. **Continental Drift**: Continental drift is the theory that the Earth's continents have moved over time. This theory was first proposed by Alfred Wegener in 1912. Continental drift is now widely accepted and is considered to be a fundamental aspect of plate tectonics.  3. **Continental Shelf**: A continental shelf is a gently sloping underwater area that extends from the shoreline to the continental slope. Continental shelves are typically shallow, with depths ranging from a few meters to several hundred meters. They are important fishing grounds and also contain valuable mineral resources.  4. **Continental Crust**: Continental crust is the type of crust that forms the continents. It is thicker and less dense than oceanic crust. Continental crust is composed of a variety of rocks, including granite, sandstone, and limestone.  5. **Continental Divide**: A continental divide is a boundary that separates two drainage basins. Water flowing on one side of the divide will eventually reach one ocean, while water flowing on the other side will reach a different ocean. The Continental Divide of the Americas is a well-known example of a continental divide.  6. **Continental Breakfast**: A continental breakfast is a light breakfast that typically includes coffee or tea, pastries, fruit, and yogurt. Continental breakfasts are often served in hotels and cafes.  These are just a few examples of the many ways in which the term "continental" can be used.</p>
