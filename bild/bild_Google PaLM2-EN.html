<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p class='aitext'> BILD is a German tabloid newspaper published by Axel Springer SE. It is the highest-circulation daily newspaper in Europe and the second-highest-circulation daily newspaper in the world, after the Japanese Yomiuri Shimbun.  BILD was founded in 1952 by Axel Springer and has since become one of the most influential newspapers in Germany. It is known for its sensationalist reporting style and its focus on celebrity news, crime, and sports.  BILD has been criticized for its often-negative portrayal of immigrants and minorities, as well as for its use of sensationalist headlines and images. However, it remains one of the most popular newspapers in Germany, with a daily circulation of over 2 million copies.  In recent years, BILD has expanded its reach beyond Germany by launching online editions in other countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom.</p>
