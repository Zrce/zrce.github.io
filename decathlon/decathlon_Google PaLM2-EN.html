<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p> Decathlon is a combined event in track and field consisting of ten track and field events. The decathlon is contested over two days, with five events on each day. The events are:  **Day 1:**  * 100 metres * Long jump * Shot put * High jump * 400 metres  **Day 2:**  * 110 metres hurdles * Discus throw * Pole vault * Javelin throw * 1500 metres  The decathlon is a demanding event that requires athletes to be proficient in a wide range of track and field events. The winner of the decathlon is the athlete who accumulates the most points across all ten events.  The decathlon was first introduced at the Olympic Games in 1912. The current world record for the decathlon is held by Kevin Mayer of France, who scored 9126 points at the 2018 DÃ©castar meeting in Talence, France.</p>
