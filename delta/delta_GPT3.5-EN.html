It can also refer to the Kronecker delta, a function that equals 1 if two indices are equal and 0 otherwise.  2. Physics: In physics, delta (∆) often represents a change or difference in a physical quantity. For example, delta-v (∆v) refers to the change in velocity, and delta-t (∆t) represents the change in time.  3. Geography: A delta is a landform that forms at the mouth of a river, where it meets a body of water, typically the ocean or a lake. Deltas are characterized by sediment deposition and the formation of intricate networks of distributaries.  4.
