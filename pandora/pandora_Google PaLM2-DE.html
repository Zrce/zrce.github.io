<p class='aitext'> Pandora is a music streaming service that allows users to create personalized radio stations based on their musical preferences. It was founded in 2000 by Tim Westergren, Will Glaser, and Jon Kraft, and is headquartered in Oakland, California. Pandora is available in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand.  Pandora uses the Music Genome Project, a database of musical attributes, to create radio stations that are tailored to each user's individual tastes. Users can create stations based on a single artist, song, or genre, and Pandora will then play similar music that matches the user's preferences. Pandora also allows users to skip songs, create playlists, and share their stations with others.  Pandora is free to use, but there is also a subscription service called Pandora Plus that offers ad-free listening, higher-quality audio, and the ability to listen to music offline. Pandora Plus costs $4.99 per month.  Pandora is one of the most popular music streaming services in the world, with over 70 million active users. It is available on a variety of devices, including smartphones, tablets, computers, and home audio systems.</p>
