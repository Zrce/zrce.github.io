<p id='aitext'> Boeing is an American multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and sells airplanes, rotorcraft, rockets, satellites, telecommunications equipment, and missiles. Headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, Boeing is the world's largest aerospace company and the second-largest defense contractor in the world based on revenue. The company employs more than 140,000 people across the United States and in more than 65 countries.  Boeing's history dates back to 1916, when William Boeing founded the Pacific Aero Products Company in Seattle, Washington. The company's first airplane, the B-1, was built in 1916 and flew for the first time in 1917. In 1917, the company was renamed Boeing Airplane Company.  Over the years, Boeing has grown into a global aerospace giant. The company's products include commercial airplanes, such as the 737, 747, and 777; military aircraft, such as the F/A-18 Super Hornet and the C-17 Globemaster III; and space systems, such as the International Space Station and the Delta IV rocket.  Boeing is also a major player in the defense industry. The company produces a wide range of military products, including fighter jets, bombers, missiles, and satellites. Boeing is also a major contractor for the United States Department of Defense.  In recent years, Boeing has faced a number of challenges, including the grounding of the 737 MAX aircraft following two fatal crashes. However, the company remains a global leader in the aerospace industry and is well-positioned for future growth.</p>
