<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p> Gatorade is a sports drink, created in 1965 by a team of researchers at the University of Florida, led by Dr. Robert Cade. It was originally developed as a way to help the Florida Gators football team stay hydrated and energized during games and practices. The drink is made with water, carbohydrates, electrolytes, and flavorings. It is designed to help athletes replace the fluids and minerals that are lost through sweat during exercise. Gatorade is now one of the most popular sports drinks in the world, and it is available in a variety of flavors and formulations.</p>
