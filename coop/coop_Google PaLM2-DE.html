<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p class='aitext'> A coop is a small enclosure, typically made of wire mesh or wood, used to house poultry such as chickens, ducks, or turkeys. Coops provide a safe and secure environment for the birds, protecting them from predators and the elements. They also allow the birds to have access to food, water, and shelter. Coops can be placed outdoors or indoors, depending on the climate and the needs of the birds. Some coops are designed to be portable, allowing them to be moved to different locations as needed.</p>
