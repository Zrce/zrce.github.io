<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p> RBC stands for Red Blood Cell. Red blood cells are specialized cells that carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body and remove carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism, from the body. They are produced in the bone marrow and have a lifespan of about 120 days.  Red blood cells are filled with a protein called hemoglobin, which binds to oxygen molecules and transports them throughout the body. The oxygen is then released into the tissues, where it is used for cellular respiration. Carbon dioxide, a waste product of cellular respiration, is then transported back to the lungs by the red blood cells and exhaled.  Red blood cells are essential for life, and a deficiency of red blood cells can lead to a condition called anemia. Anemia can cause a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, and pale skin.</p>
