<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p id='aitext'> **Puma** (Puma concolor), also known as the mountain lion, cougar, panther, or catamount, is a large felid of the subfamily Felinae native to the Americas. It is an ambush predator, primarily targeting deer, but it also hunts other mammals, birds, and fish. The puma is an adaptable and opportunistic predator, and its diet varies depending on its habitat and prey availability.  Pumas are solitary animals, except during mating season. They are territorial, and their ranges can vary from 20 to 1,000 square kilometers (8 to 386 square miles). Pumas are most active at dawn and dusk, but they can also be active during the day.  Pumas are sexually mature at around 2-3 years of age. Females give birth to 1-6 kittens every 2-3 years. The kittens are born blind and helpless, but they develop quickly and are able to hunt on their own by the time they are 1 year old. Pumas can live for up to 20 years in the wild.  Pumas are found in a variety of habitats, from rainforests to deserts. They are most common in mountainous areas, but they can also be found in grasslands, forests, and swamps. Pumas are found throughout the Americas, from Canada to Argentina.  Pumas are not typically aggressive towards humans, but they have been known to attack people who have surprised them or who have threatened their young. Pumas are also known to prey on livestock, which can lead to conflicts with humans.  Pumas are an important part of the ecosystem. They help to control the populations of their prey species, and they also scavenge on dead animals. Pumas are a threatened species in some parts of their range, due to habitat loss, hunting, and persecution.</p>
