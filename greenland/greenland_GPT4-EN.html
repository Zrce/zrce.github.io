<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p>Greenland is the world's largest island that is not a continent. It is located between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. It is an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark. Though physiographically and ethnically an Arctic island country and geographically a part of the continent of North America, politically and historically Greenland is associated with Europe, specifically Norway and Denmark. The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors migrated from Alaska through Northern Canada, gradually settling across the island by the 13th century.</p>
