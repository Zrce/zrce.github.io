<p> Primark, also known as Penney's in the Republic of Ireland, is an Irish multinational fast fashion retailer with headquarters in Dublin, Ireland. The company operates over 370 stores in 14 countries across Europe and North America. Primark is known for its low-cost clothing and accessories, and is a popular destination for budget-conscious shoppers.  The company was founded in 1969 by Arthur Ryan as a single store in Dublin. It quickly expanded throughout Ireland and the United Kingdom, and in 2006, Primark opened its first store in the United States. The company has since continued to expand its international presence, and now has stores in Spain, Portugal, Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria, Slovenia, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary.  Primark is a subsidiary of Associated British Foods, a British multinational food processing and retailing company. The company employs over 70,000 people worldwide, and generates annual revenues of over Â£7 billion.  Primark has been criticized for its labor practices, and has been accused of paying its workers poverty wages and failing to provide safe working conditions. The company has also been criticized for its environmental practices, and has been accused of contributing to pollution and waste.  Despite these criticisms, Primark remains a popular destination for budget-conscious shoppers. The company's low prices and wide variety of clothing and accessories make it a popular choice for people of all ages and incomes.</p>
