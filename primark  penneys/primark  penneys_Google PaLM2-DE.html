<p> Primark, also known as Penney's in the Republic of Ireland, is an Irish multinational fast fashion retailer with headquarters in Dublin, Ireland. The company operates over 370 stores in 14 countries across Europe and North America. Primark is known for its low-cost clothing and accessories, and is a popular destination for budget-conscious shoppers.  The company was founded in 1969 by Arthur Ryan as a single store in Dublin. It expanded rapidly throughout Ireland and the United Kingdom in the 1970s and 1980s, and began its international expansion in the 1990s. Primark opened its first store in the United States in 2006, and has since expanded to several other countries, including Spain, Portugal, Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria, Slovenia, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary.  Primark is a subsidiary of Associated British Foods, a British multinational food processing and retailing company. The company employs over 70,000 people worldwide and generates annual revenue of over Â£7 billion.  Primark has been criticized for its labor practices, including allegations of poor working conditions and low wages in its factories in developing countries. The company has also been criticized for its environmental impact, including its use of non-renewable resources and its contribution to textile waste.  Despite these criticisms, Primark remains a popular destination for budget-conscious shoppers around the world. The company's low prices and wide variety of clothing and accessories continue to attract customers, and Primark is expected to continue to grow in the coming years.</p>
