<p class='aitext'>Postal Savings Bank refers to a type of financial institution that operates under the postal system of a country. These banks are typically owned and operated by the government and provide basic banking services to individuals and small businesses. Postal Savings Banks are known for their accessibility and convenience, as they often have a wide network of branches and ATMs across the country. They offer services such as savings accounts, remittances, bill payments, and small loans. Postal Savings Banks aim to promote financial inclusion by providing banking services to people in remote areas or those who may not have access to traditional banks.</p>
