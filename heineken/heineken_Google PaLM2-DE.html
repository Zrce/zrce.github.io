<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p class='aitext'> Heineken is a Dutch pale lager beer. It is the world's third-largest brewing company by volume. Heineken is brewed in more than 70 countries and is available in over 190 countries. The company was founded in 1864 by Gerard Adriaan Heineken in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Heineken is a bottom-fermented beer, which means that the yeast settles at the bottom of the fermentation tank. This type of beer is typically lighter in color and has a higher alcohol content than top-fermented beers. Heineken is also known for its distinctive green bottle, which was introduced in 1873. The company's slogan is "Heineken: The Original Premium Beer."</p>
