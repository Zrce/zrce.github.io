<p class='aitext'> Gliss is a musical term that refers to a smooth, continuous slide from one pitch to another. It is also known as a portamento or a slide. Glissandos can be performed on any instrument, but they are most commonly associated with stringed instruments and the human voice.  To perform a glissando, the musician starts on one pitch and then gradually slides up or down to another pitch. The slide can be slow and sustained, or it can be fast and abrupt. Glissandos can be used to create a variety of effects, such as tension, suspense, or excitement.  Glissandos are often used in classical music, jazz, and blues. They can also be found in popular music, such as rock, pop, and country. Some famous examples of glissandos include the opening of the Beatles' song "Strawberry Fields Forever" and the guitar solo in Jimi Hendrix's song "Purple Haze."  Glissandos are a versatile musical technique that can be used to create a variety of effects. They are a valuable tool for any musician who wants to add some excitement and interest to their playing.</p>
