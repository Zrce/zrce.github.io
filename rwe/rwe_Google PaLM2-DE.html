<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p> Real-world evidence (RWE) is data collected outside of traditional clinical trials that can be used to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of medical products. RWE can come from a variety of sources, including electronic health records, claims data, patient registries, and social media.  RWE is increasingly being used to support regulatory decisions, such as the approval of new drugs and devices. This is because RWE can provide real-world insights into the safety and effectiveness of medical products that cannot be obtained from clinical trials alone. For example, RWE can be used to study the long-term effects of a drug or device, or to identify rare side effects that may not be seen in clinical trials.  RWE is also being used to improve the quality of care. For example, RWE can be used to identify patients who are not receiving the best possible care, or to develop new ways to improve patient outcomes.  RWE is a valuable tool that can be used to improve the safety and effectiveness of medical products and to improve the quality of care.</p>
