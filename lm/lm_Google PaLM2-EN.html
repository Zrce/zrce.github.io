<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p id='aitext'> **L&M** stands for **Liggett & Myers**, a former American tobacco company. It was founded in 1873 by John B. Liggett and James R. Myers in St. Louis, Missouri. The company produced a variety of tobacco products, including cigarettes, cigars, and pipe tobacco. L&M was one of the largest tobacco companies in the United States in the early 20th century. However, the company's fortunes declined in the late 20th century due to increased competition and declining smoking rates. In 1999, L&M was acquired by Philip Morris International.</p>
