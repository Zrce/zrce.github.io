<p class='aitext'> Nokia Oyj is a Finnish multinational telecommunications, information technology, and consumer electronics company, founded in 1865. Headquartered in Espoo, Finland, Nokia is one of the world's largest telecommunications equipment manufacturers and a major contributor to the development of the mobile phone industry.  Nokia's history can be traced back to the 19th century when it started as a paper mill. Over the years, the company diversified into various industries, including rubber, cables, and electronics. In the 1980s, Nokia focused on telecommunications and quickly became a global leader in mobile phone technology.  Nokia's success in the mobile phone market was driven by several factors, including its early adoption of the GSM standard, innovative product designs, and strong marketing strategies. The company's iconic devices, such as the Nokia 3310 and Nokia 1100, became widely popular and helped establish Nokia as a household name.  However, Nokia faced challenges in the late 2000s due to the rise of smartphones and intense competition from Apple and Android-based devices. The company struggled to adapt to the changing market dynamics and lost its dominant position in the smartphone market.  In 2013, Nokia sold its mobile phone business to Microsoft in a deal worth approximately $7.2 billion. The company then shifted its focus towards network infrastructure, software, and services. Nokia has since regained its strength in the telecommunications industry and is now a major player in 5G technology and network solutions.  Today, Nokia Oyj operates in various segments, including Mobile Networks, Network Infrastructure, Cloud and Network Services, and Nokia Technologies. The company employs over 90,000 people worldwide and has a presence in over 130 countries. Nokia is listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange and is a component of the OMX Helsinki 25 Index.</p>
