<h2>AI reply text</h2>
<p id='aitext'> Nokia Oyj is a Finnish multinational telecommunications, information technology, and consumer electronics company, founded in 1865. Headquartered in Espoo, Finland, Nokia is one of the world's largest telecommunications equipment manufacturers and a global leader in the mobile phone market.  Nokia's history can be traced back to the 19th century when it was founded as a paper mill. Over the years, the company diversified into various industries, including rubber, cables, and electronics. In the 1980s, Nokia became a major player in the mobile phone market and quickly rose to prominence as a global leader in the industry.  Nokia's success was driven by its innovative products and technologies, such as the introduction of the first GSM phone in 1992 and the development of the Symbian operating system for smartphones. The company's iconic devices, such as the Nokia 3310 and the Nokia N95, became widely popular and helped establish Nokia's brand recognition worldwide.  However, Nokia faced challenges in the late 2000s due to the rise of competitors like Apple and Samsung, who introduced innovative smartphones with user-friendly interfaces and powerful features. Nokia's market share declined, and the company struggled to keep up with the rapid pace of technological advancements.  In 2013, Nokia sold its mobile phone business to Microsoft in a deal worth approximately $7.2 billion. The company then shifted its focus towards network infrastructure and telecommunications equipment, providing solutions for mobile operators, enterprises, and governments.  Today, Nokia Oyj is a global leader in the telecommunications industry, offering a wide range of products and services, including 5G network infrastructure, IP routing, optical networking, and software solutions. The company has a strong presence in various markets worldwide and continues to invest in research and development to drive innovation in the telecommunications sector.</p>
